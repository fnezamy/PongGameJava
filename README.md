#Pong Game in Java

#Description

The game is a simple pong game. The objective is to not allow the ball to bounce off the wall on your side. If the ball bounces three times off your wall, you lose. But, if you get the ball to bounce three times off the AI's wall you win!

You play simply by pressing the "W" key to move up and the "S" key to move down.
